The purpose of HW2 is to learn how to obtain confidence interval (CI) of a function based on the estimated betas.

Use the estimation results from HW1 on willingness to pay for all non-price attributes. Then compute their 95% CIs using

1. Residual Bootstrap

2. Data Bootstrap

3. Monte Carlo simulations

Format: Present the output in one PDF file as follows:

(A) Make a table with a list of non-price attribute levels in rows. The columns contain the median WTP and the lower (2.5th percentile) and upper (97.5th percentile). Report results in one table for residual bootstrap, another table for data bootstrap, and yet another table for Monte Carlo simulations.

(B) In the same PDF file, briefly explain your understanding of what is the residual bootstrap and the data bootstrap.
