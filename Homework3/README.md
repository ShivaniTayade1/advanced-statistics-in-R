The purpose of HW3 is to learn Principal Components Analysis and Principal Components Regression via a business application to visualize brand competition.

1. Build brand maps for car brands using Cars_Data.xlsx. The client's brand name is Infinity.

2. Determine how many factors to retain? 

3. Assign names to the retained factors (you may need to flip the factors and then assign names).

4. Explain iso-preference line and its difference from the regression line.

5. Explain what is an ideal vector and why it indicates the direction of increasing preferences.

6. Compute the angles of iso-preference line and ideal vector arrow.

7. Find 95% confidence interval for the angle of the ideal vector. Use data bootstrap method we learnt in Class 2.

8. Recommend to Infinity's managers what they should do to improve their product design
