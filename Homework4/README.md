The purpose of HW4 is to learn how to estimate marketing mix models, which require nonlinearity to capture diminishing returns to marketing spends. Apply the same steps as we did in class 3b, but (1) replace the log transformation with square-root transformation for the marketing spends and (2) no transformation for DV and Lagged Sales.

Then answer the following questions:

Q1. How does sqrt transformation differ conceptually from the log transformation for diminishing returns? (1 point)

Q2. What is the elasticity of each of the marketing spends? (1 point)

Q3. How does online elasticity change in the presence of holidays? (1 point)

Q4. Is the sqrt-transformed model better than the log-transformed one we studied in class? (1 point)

Q5. What should be the total budget in the long run? (1 point)
