The goal of HW5 is to learn how to estimate nonlinear regression models. To this end, you will do the following:

1. Formulate the tri-logistic model by extending the bi-logistic model. Extend it similar to how we extended the logistic model (one peak) to bi-logistic model (two peaks).

2. Estimate the tri-logistic model using data up to 140 weeks (training data)

 

Deliverables:

1.Explain what is "Nonlinear" in nonlinear regression models?

2. Report the parameter estimates, their SEs, and 95% CIs 

3. Predict sales from weeks 140 through 199 (test sample aka holdout sample)

4. Provide 95% CIs for the predicted sales via Monte Carlo Simulation (see class 3 content/code on Monte Carlo CIs)

5. What percentage of actual observations are within your prediction intervals?
