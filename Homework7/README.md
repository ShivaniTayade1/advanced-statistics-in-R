The purpose of HW7 is to learn how to apply Holt-Winters forecasting to extract level, trend, seasonality and make forecast for future h weeks.

Deliverables:

1. Select one of the weather time series from data_week.csv

2. Try the four combinations of beta (on/off) and gamma (on/off)

3. Present the plots of data series, trend, and seasonal components for each of the four combinations

4. Make out-of-sample forecast for 26 weeks with confidence bands. 

5. Recommend one forecasting model -- give your justification (Hint: use AIC and BIC)
